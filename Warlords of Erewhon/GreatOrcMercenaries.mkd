# Great Orc Mercenaries

## Preamble
[Warmonger Miniatures](https://www.warmongerminiatures.com/) has a range of larger than normal Orcs that are prefect to be fielded as a hero or an elite mercenary force.  Typically though, they will only be hired by [Orcs](https://thisgaminglife.uk/tag/orcs/) or [Pig-faced Orcs](https://thisgaminglife.uk/tag/pig-faced-orcs/).

## Great Orc Army List

### Great Orc / Ogre Mercenaries handgonners
Points Value: 75<BR>
Special: You may include one unit of Great Orc Mercenary handgonners in a Orc, Pig-Faced orc, or Goblin army (or any army you like really).  The handgonnes are so big they count as two ranged attacks, and the Great Orcs wield them as clubs in hand-to-hand.

| Warrior Unit: Great Orc Mercenary Hero          | Ag   | Acc | Str  | Res | Init | Co   | Special                       |
|:------------------------------------------------|:----:|:----|-----:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:------------------------------|
| 3 x Great Orc Mercenaries with huge handgonners |  5   | 5   | 6    | 6   | 8    | 8    | 2 x Ranged, 1x HtH SV0        |

 * Add up to two more Great Orcs @25pts per model

***NB:*** The rules for the huge handgonnes are experimental but I don't expect they will be unbalanced.
