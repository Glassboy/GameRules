Lycanthropy: Upon being issued with a Down order, the unit can choose to transform into a powerful
hybrid. The unit’s statline is replaced with the purchased hybrid while transformed. Replace the
model with something suitably imposing on the tabletop. The unit keeps all the pin markers and
rolled damage results while transformed.
If the unit fails an Order Test while transformed, it immediately returns to its original form and may
not transform again this turn. They also follow the normal procedure for down orders.
