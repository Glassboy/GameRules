# **Vikings**

Version 0.3  
Updated:  January 30th 2022

The Vikings list is primarily to play a historical warband without the use of any magic.  However it can be adapted to playing a normal game of Warlords of Erewhon by adding units from the Fantasy section of the list.

It's suggested that the majority of the warband consists of Bóndi and Thrall units.  

While there have been graves found with female skeletons and weapons as grave goods, there is no evidence of entire units of trained female warriors so the Shieldmaidens unit can be found in the Fantasy section of the list.

The list has been designed around the excellent Viking miniatures available from companies like 

* Wargames Foundry  
* Artizan  
* Crusader  
* Victrix  
* Gripping Beast.
