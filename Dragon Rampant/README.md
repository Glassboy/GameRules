# Dragon Rampant
When Tim Prow ran the first Kickstarter that launched his [Diehard Miniatures](https://diehardminiatures.com/) range, he wanted them to be able to be used immediately in some of the Osprey Games that were in vogue at the time.  To properly represent the Eru-kin, a high-tech race stranded on a low-tech high-fantasy planet I created a number of new Fantastical Rules.  With that out of the way, and with the permission of Osprey, an [Eru-kin warband](Erukin%20Warband.mkd) was written up and made available to the backers.  

As I had a large Dwarf army for another fantasy game, the [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd) needed to expand to accommodate it as did the [Unit Profiles](New%20Unit%20Profiles.mkd).
