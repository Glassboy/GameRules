# Dragon Rampant
When Tim Prow launched his first Kickstarter for the [Diehard Miniatures](https://diehardminiatures.com/) range, he wanted the miniatures to be immediately useful in the Osprey Games that were in vogue at the time.  To properly represent the Eru-kin, a high-tech race stranded on a low-tech high-fantasy planet I created a number of new [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd).  With the [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd) written, and with the permission of Osprey, I wrote the [Eru-kin warband](Erukin%20Warband.mkd) and it was included in the Kickstarter rewards.  

As I had a large Dwarf army for another fantasy game which I struggled to use fully in Dragon Rampant, the [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd) were expanded to accommodate it, and additional [Unit Profiles](New%20Unit%20Profiles.mkd) were created.
