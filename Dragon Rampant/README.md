# Dragon Rampant
When Tim Prow launched his first Kickstarter for the [Diehard Miniatures](https://diehardminiatures.com/) range, he wanted the miniatures to be immediately useful in the Osprey Games that were popular at the time. To properly represent the Eru-kin - a high-tech race stranded on a low-tech, high-fantasy planet - I created a number of new [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd) for Dragon Rampant. And the [Eru-kin warband](Erukin%20Warband.mkd) was included in the Kickstarter rewards (with Osprey's permission).

Since I had a large Dwarf army for another fantasy game that I was struggling to fully utilize in Dragon Rampant, I expanded the [Fantastical Rules](Fantastical%20Rules.mkd) to accommodate it and created additional [Unit Profiles](New%20Unit%20Profiles.mkd).
