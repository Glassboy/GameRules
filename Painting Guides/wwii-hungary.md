# Hungary (Eastern front)

During World War II, the Royal Hungarian Army served as a member of the Axis powers, having joined the Tripartite Pact in November 1940. Initially constrained by the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary began rearming in the late 1930s and fielded a modernizing force that included infantry, cavalry, mountain brigades, river forces, and eventually armored and parachute units. Hungarian troops participated in the invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, with their Eastern Front deployment marked by harsh winter conditions and significant casualties. By 1942, Hungary had committed an entire army to the Soviet campaign, culminating in the devastating losses at the Battle of Stalingrad and the Don River.

As the war progressed, Hungary attempted to negotiate peace with the Allies, prompting Germany to occupy the country in 1944 under Operation Margarethe. The Hungarian army, now under fascist leadership, fought alongside German forces during the brutal Siege of Budapest in late 1944 and early 1945. Despite fierce resistance, the city fell to the advancing Soviet and Romanian troops, marking the collapse of Hungary’s military efforts. Hungarian forces were active primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, including operations in Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and the Carpathian region, with their final stand centered around the defense of Budapest.
